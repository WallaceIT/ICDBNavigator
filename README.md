ICDBNavigator (or "ICDBN") requires a PHP server - like Apache or the lightweight Mongoose - and an SQLite / MySQL database to work.
To install it, clone the repo in a folder accessible and writable from the server and run setup.php in a browser.

More documentation is a work-in-progress.

Tested in Chromium and Firefox under Linux.
